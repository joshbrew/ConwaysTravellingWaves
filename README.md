# Conway's Travelling Waves
Cortical Travelling Waves overlaid with Conway's Game of Life or Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky Automata to perturb the phase space. Based on cortical travelling waves which are harmonic oscillators that sync up to each other based on a nearest neighbor search (defined by a "Mexican Hat" radius)
